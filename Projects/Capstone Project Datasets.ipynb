    "Facebook has become quite popular in the recent few years with people all over the world using it as a medium to share their status,thoughts and pictures with their friends. With the mobile app , it has become even more popular and easier to access.

We are trying to study the dataset provided to identify certain patterns with respect to how the users are making use of this most popular social networking app depending on their age group,gender etc."
